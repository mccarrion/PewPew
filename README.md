# PewPew
A Rust game about appreciating laser beams.

### Roadmap for this Game
This is the current roadmap for this repo. Bullet points represent general order
that development will move along, but may change slightly as the project moves
forward.

First set of goals:
- [x] Draw player
- [ ] Render pixel art
- [ ] Handle player input
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Draw non-player objects
- [ ] Add AI to non-player objects

### Game Engine
This game will use the ggez engine for development. Current code for this game is drawing heavily from 05_astroblasto.rs code in the example set provided by ggez. Once base is built out and working, code will diverge more heavily towards arena based shooter.

### Goal of this Repo
The end goal would be to create a 16 bit arena zombie shooter.
