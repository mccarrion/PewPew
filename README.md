# PewPew
A Rust game about appreciating laser beams.

### Roadmap for this Game
This is the current roadmap for this repo. Bullet points represent general order
that development will move along, but may change slightly as the project moves
forward.

First set of goals:
- [x] Draw player
- [ ] Render pixel art
- [ ] Handle player input
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Draw non-player objects
- [ ] Add AI to non-player objects

### Game Engine
This game will use the ggez engine for development. Current iteration of this game is based on 05_astroblasto in the example set provided by ggez. After a working iteration is complete, code will begin to be restructered and refactored in a direction away from 05_astroblasto for the purposes of originality and being
a work that can stand on its own.

### Goal of this Repo
The end goal would be to create a 16 bit arena zombie shooter.
